    "Main Concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) :\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Class: \n",
    "\n",
    "A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints or the prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a logical entity that contains some attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Objects:\n",
    "\n",
    "The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object consists of :\n",
    "\n",
    "State: It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior: It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identity: It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The class that derives properties is called the derived class or child class and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of inheritance are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It represents real-world relationships well.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It provides the reusability of a code. We don’t have to write the same code again and again. Also, it allows us to add more features to a class without modifying it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is transitive in nature, which means that if class B inherits from another class A, then all the subclasses of B would automatically inherit from class A.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism simply means having many forms. For example, we need to determine if the given species of birds fly or not, using polymorphism we can do this using a single function.\n",
    "\n",
    "v. Encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, private variables are defined with double underscore symbols(__a) and protected variables are defined with the help of a single underscore(_a)."
